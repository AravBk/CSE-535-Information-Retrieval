# CSE-535-Information-Retrieval
This repository contains My Final Project for Information Retrieval during my first semester at University at Buffalo.

The course had 4 projects in total :

1. Collecting and Indexing Documents in Solr
2. Boolean Query Processing and using DAAT and sorted using TF-IDF scoring.
3. Evaluating different IR models (BM25 or VSM).
   Playing arounf with variables and getting better scores.
4. Built a Fully Developed Search Engine written in AngularJS, Used Twitter API to collect data and index them.

The Final Project was an implementation of all the initial projects during the semester which we had to use to create our own search engine from scratch.
